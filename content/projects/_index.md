# Projects

Like most people in the computer science world, all of my work is version controlled. As a byproduct of this tendancy my GitHub is both a portfolio of my work and a graveyard for the many hobby-projects that got left along the way 🪦

Below is a concise list of <u>completed</u> projects that have shaped my journey in this field.
