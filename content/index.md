Hey I'm Joel 👋

I have had the privelege of working on computer science "things" for about 6 years now. Over that time I've donned many caps. Initially as a <u><b>mobile app developer</b></u>, then as a <u><b>machine learning enthusiast</b></u>, followed by a role as a <u><b>systems engineer</b></u> and now as a <u><b>compiler researcher</b></u>. My experiences from working across these subdomains have informed my understanding of the full stack, from application code down to the underlying infrastructure that runs this code.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, we should talk!
